In this work, we propose the reasons for different forming voltage by microscopic analysis on the oxygen vacancies conductive filaments.

---

Through analysis, the initial configuration of oxygen vacancy will impact the further formation process of condcutive filament, contributing to the difference in forming voltage. While, after formation, the morphology is the same and therefore the ON/OFF state is simliar. Here's a figure of the inital state we give, for illustration only.
