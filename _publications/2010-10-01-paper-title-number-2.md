This paper proposes a systematic framework to simulate the large interacting particle system in semiconductor. Based on a classic drift-diffusion model, we simulate the evolution within the device. We also relate such dynamics to the physic and electrical behavior of the device. [Full Text](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369800122000403)
