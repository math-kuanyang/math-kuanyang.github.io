In this work, I shoulder the simulation part, in which the current density, copper atoms and oxygen vacancy distribution schematically illustrate the dynamic formation and rupture process of conductive filament by Markov Random Field model. The conduction mechanism is concluded as that the electrons would hop among oxygen vacancies for low voltage but migrate through the Cu CF after the formation.

Here's a sample of what we've done in this work, the microscopic illustration of the configuration of ions and current density.
