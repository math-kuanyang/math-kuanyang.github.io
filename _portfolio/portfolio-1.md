With Prof. Alexander Strohmaier, I am undergoing some basic work on numerical experiments with the eigenvalue and eigenfunction of operators. I may further expand these work to more PDEs and SDEs for practical usage.

<br/><img src='/images/eigen2.png'>*This is another transformation. We transform that to $E^2$ space*
