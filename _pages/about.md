### Biography
I am Kuan, Bachelor student in Mathmatics in Cuiying Honors College, Lanzhou University.

I've been in Changzhou Provincial Senior High School of Jiangsu for 3 - year general high school study, which gives me a solid academic basis. After that, I've been admitted to Lanzhou University for 4-year bachelor study in Mathematics. Since year two, I have became a candidate in China's Top Notch Undergraduate Training Program held by Central Government. I have been selected to take part in a studying abroad program in University of Leeds for Mathematics by Ministry of Education.

My interest is about stochastic analysis. And up to now, my research projects are mainly in two aspects, one is for the application of stochastic models and the other is on theoretical discovering. One is for the numerical simulation for Resistive Random - Access Memory (RRAM). The obstacle for the mass production for RRAM is generally attributed to the variability in resistance value. Since sophomore year, I focused on the mechanism explanation for the resistive switching mechanism, based on which we want to realize precise control for the resistance for RRAM. The novelty of our work compromises the advance in algorithm and the way we present our results. Most of simulation work relies on the Monte Carlo Model, while I recognized the stochastic natural of resistive switching process and therefore applied stochastic model including random walk and Markov random field model to simulate the process. Another point is that most of the work only report the simulated results by I-V curve fitting, which is less straightforward and very difficult for readers to understand what happened inside the device. My simulation is done at microscopic level and the whole dynamic process can be vividly presented. 

Another project is on the eigenvalue and eigenfunction of differential equations. From this work, I estimated to learn things about Calderon projectors, Dirichlet to Neumann map, some elements of pseudodifferential operators and a bit of intuition about the meaning of eigenfunctions, which are generally with regards to pure mathematics. I want to further transplant some of the understandings to the investigation on SDEs.

I want to thank Dr. Ying-tao Li, Prof. Jing QI and Prof. Alexander Strohmaier for their kindest assistance. The research projects are sponsored by Hui-Chun Chin and Tsung-Dao Lee Chinese Undergraduate Research Endowment, China's Top - Notch Undergraduate Training Program, Cuiying Foundation.
