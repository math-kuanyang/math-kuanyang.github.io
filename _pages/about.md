### Biography
I am Kuan, Postgraduate Student in Mathematics and Computational Finance in University of Oxford. I have received a Bachelorâ€™s degree with Honors in Mathematics from Cuiying Honors College, Lanzhou University.

My current attempt is mathematical modelling for dynamical systems based on stochastic and PDE methods. 
With stochastic methods, I have worked on theoretical part of device physics. I simulated the [migration of particles based on drift-diffusion models](/publications/), based on which we revealed the mechanism of the resistive switching behaviour in selected devices. For [computational finance](/portfolio/signature/), I am working on prediction and analysis of random behavior in stock market through stochastic methods, such as signature method and statistical learning. This has been supported and collaborated with TaiLong Bank for developping trading strategy for bonds. 
The [spectral theory project](portfolio/portfolio-1/) is an experience in the area of PDE and dynamical systems. It casts me a straightforward angle to understand dynamics and systems by characteristics such as eigenvalues. It is also a powerful tool to formulate and compute complicated systems with irregular boundary and conditions.

My undergraduate education supports me with solid foundation and equips me with clear mathematical logic. I am grateful to many professors that have ever supported me. Not only knowledge, but they give me enthusiasm to explore mathematically.
