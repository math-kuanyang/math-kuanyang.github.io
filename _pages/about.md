### Biography
I am Kuan, Junior Quantitative Trader at [DV Trading LLC](https://www.dvtrading.co). I recieved MSc degree in Mathematical and Computational Finance from University of Oxford and also BSc in Mathematics from Lanzhou University. I've been a Quant Research Intern on Global Systematic Trading Desk at [Schonfeld](https://www.schonfeld.com).

My research interests are stochastic control and optimization. I also have solid basis in stochastic process, dynamical systems (PDE), probability and calculus.

For industry, I have worked in assets including commodities and rates futures and crypto. I am particularly interested in market making and statistical arbitrage area.

I code in C++, KDB/Q, Python. I have experience with Linux/UNIX, LaTeX, Markdown, HTML.

### [Conference Presentations](/talks/)

### [Industrial Collaborations](/projects/)
1. [Correlation Analysis for Energy Futures Market](/portfolio/emission_markets_2/). This work starts from basic non-arbitrage theory, but further compromises ideas from game theory. [Background](/portfolio/emission_markets_1/), [Scripts](/portfolio/emission_markets_3/)
2. [Stochastic Modelling for Crypto Market](/portfolio/BTC_prediction/). This framework is inspired by the current poor performance of StatsML model. We use a Cox model and this could be easily extended to a Market Making Strategy through control theory.
3. [Signature Method](/portfolio/signature/). This is a variant of StatsML method. It uses signature as a feature for prediction. This achieves better efficiency and precision under several occasions.
