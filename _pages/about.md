### Biography
I am Kuan, senior year Mathematics student in Cuiying Honors College, Lanzhou University. Before that, I was in Changzhou Provincial Senior High School of Jiangsu for 3 - year general high school study, with solid academic basis gained. Since sophomore year, I have became a candidate in China's Top Notch Undergraduate Training Program held by Central Government. I've also been awarded a fully-funded studying abroad opportunity in Mathematics in University of Leeds during 2019-2020 by Ministry of Education and home university.

My recent attempt is about stochastic analysis along with its practical utilization in cross disciplinary background. In detail, I'm currently undergoing numerical simulation for Resistive Random - Access Memory (RRAM) through stochastic models. In this area, most of simulation work relies on the Monte Carlo Model, while we recognized the stochastic nature of resistive switching process and therefore applied stochastic model including random walk and Markov random field model to simulate the process, formulating and scaling down such a high-dimensional problem. These methods enable microscopic observation towards the internal changes of particles, bringing these tiny dynamics to a straightforward level while benefiting the mechanism explanation.

A hyped, even mainstream method in stochastic analysis and modelling could be Machine Learning method. However, although precise estimation it could draw, poor the motivation and the mechanism explanation would be the obstacle of part of them. While in my hope, I want to understand them in terms of more mathematical method as (stochastic) differential equations. I'm now doing an introductory work on spectral theory, in which equations would be the focus and the cores towards dynamics could be systematically interpreted. In context of dynamical system, the spectrum represents fundamental mechanics of the system, such as, energy levels, frequencies. It shows clearly the mechanics and motivation, connecting dynamical systems. How could the notion be expanded for stochastic systems and practical issues? Working on spectral theory already shed light on the random systems, and I hope that it is I that mathematically understand the system, instead of machine with its stubborn numerical operations.

I want to thank Dr. Ying-tao Li, Prof. Jing Qi, Prof. Deyan He and Prof. Alexander Strohmaier for their kindest assistance. I'm sponsored by Hui-Chun Chin and Tsung-Dao Lee Chinese Undergraduate Research Endowment, China's Top - Notch Undergraduate Training Program, Cuiying Foundation.
