### Biography
I am Kuan, Bachelor student in Mathmatics in Cuiying Honors College, Lanzhou University.

I've been in Changzhou Provincial Senior High School of Jiangsu for 3 - year general high school study, which gives me a solid academic basis. After that, I've been admitted to Lanzhou University for 4-year bachelor study in Mathematics. Since year two, I have became a candidate in China's Top Notch Undergraduate Training Program held by Central Government. I have been selected to take part in a studying abroad program in University of Leeds for Mathematics by Ministry of Education.

I am currently undergoing some projects in Numerical Simulation for certain problems with my tutor. Many mathematical methodologies, such as Stochastic Process (Poission Process, Markov Chain Monte Carlo)  and programming strategy are studied and implemented in my project. These projects exposed me to oppoturnites to apply what I learned and make mathematics charming and mysterious.

All my projects are sponsored by Ministry of Education of China.
