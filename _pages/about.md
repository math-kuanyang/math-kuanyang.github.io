### Biography
I am Kuan, Bachelor student in Mathmatics in Cuiying Honors College, Lanzhou University.

I've been in Changzhou Provincial Senior High School of Jiangsu for 3 - year general high school study, which gives me a solid academic basis. After that, I've been admitted to Lanzhou University for 4-year bachelor study in Mathematics. Since year two, I have became a candidate in China's Top Notch Undergraduate Training Program held by Central Government. I have been selected to take part in a studying abroad program in University of Leeds for Mathematics by Ministry of Education.

My recent attempt is about stochastic analysis and statistics for practical issues in cross disciplinary background. In detail,  I'm currently undergoing numerical simulation for Resistive Random - Access Memory (RRAM) through stochastic models and statsitical methods. In this area, most of simulation work relies on the Monte Carlo Model, while we recognized the stochastic nature of resistive switching process and therefore applied stochastic model including random walk and Markov random field model to simulate the process, formulating and scaling down such a high-dimensional problem. Moreover, statistical methods, including regression model are also incorporated.

I will gradually shift to the theoretical work in the setting of stochastic problems. I am also doing an introductory work on spectral theory, along with the eigenvalue and eigenfunction of differential equations. From this work, I estimate to obtain intuition on numerical analysis and also the general strucutre of a dynamical system. Further, for PDE and ODE, the spectrum represents many core content of the mechanics, for example, energy levels, frequencies, but can we cast insight into SDE through a similar method? We have to consider the failure in smoothness. I hope through this introductory project and the intuition from the initial numerican experiments, I can explore and create forms like spectrum, to analzye a stochastic process concisely and generally.

I want to thank Dr. Ying-tao Li, Prof. Jing Qi and Prof. Alexander Strohmaier for their kindest assistance. I'm sponsored by Hui-Chun Chin and Tsung-Dao Lee Chinese Undergraduate Research Endowment, China's Top - Notch Undergraduate Training Program, Cuiying Foundation.
