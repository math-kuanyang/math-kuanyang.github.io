### Biography
I am Kuan, Postgraduate Student in Mathematics and Computational Finance in University of Oxford. I have received a Bachelorâ€™s degree with Honors in Cuiying Honors College, Lanzhou University. I am also a Chun-Tsung Scholar.

My current attempt involves mathematical modelling for cross-disciplinary purposes. In the area of Physics, I have implemented a stochastic model to simulate the migration of particles within Resistive Random - Access Memory, based on which we analysed the mechanism of the resistive switching behaviour. For computational finance, I am learning stochastic based methods for the prediction and analysis of random behavior in stock market. This has been supported and collaborated with TaiLong Bank to look for Trading strategy for bonds. I have included these trails in project section. Another project is the spectral theory project, which equipped me with a powerful tool in computing dynamical systems. More importantly, it transforms the way I think about random systems. I have also applied mathematics strategies in evidence-based research and education.

My undergraduate education lays solid foundation and equip me with mathematical logic. I am grateful for many professors that have ever supported me. They teach me knowledge but I get full enthusiasm.
