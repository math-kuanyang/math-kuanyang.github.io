### Biography
I am Kuan, Graduate in Mathematics and Computational Finance in University of Oxford. I have received a Bachelorâ€™s degree with Honors in Cuiying Honors College, Lanzhou University. I am also a Chun-Tsung Scholar.

My recent attempt is about stochastic analysis and its practical utilization in cross disciplinary background. In the area of Physics, I have implemented a stochastic model to simulate the migration of particles within Resistive Random - Access Memory, which contributes to the formation of conductive filament and the resistive switching behaviour. For computational finance, I am focused on stochastic based methods for the prediction and analysis. For example, in my BSc thesis, I exploited the extraordinary strength of rough path method in predicting evolution and tendency to predict market behaviour. I have also applied mathematics strategies in evidence-based research and education.

I have to sincerely thank Prof. Alexander Strohmaier in University of Leeds. He has tutored me on the project on spectral theory, scattering matrix and differential equations. Not only does this project equip me with skills in numerical analysis and some very handy tools as FEM, it but also brings me to a higher level in considering dynamic systems. When solving practical issues, even for those in complicated stochastic aspects, these methods cast me with intuition, inspiration and full enthusiasm.
