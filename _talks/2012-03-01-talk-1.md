Plenary Talk, Invited by Hui-Chun Chin and Tsung-Dao Lee Research Endowment Committee.
In This Talk, the morphology of conductive filament in RRAM from experiment and the related resistive switching behavior are reported, based on which I did the simulation work to analyze the underlying mechanism. The talk also reported the algorithm, Markov Random Field model, which achieves satisfying precision and scales down the calculation.
