In <a href = "http://news.lzu.edu.cn/c/202011/74226.html“>This Talk </a>, the morphology of conductive filament in RRAM from experiment and the related resistive switching behavior are reported, based on which I did the simulation work to analyze the underlying mechanism. The talk also reported the algorithm, Markov Random Field model, which achieves satisfying precision and scales down the calculation. 

This talk was invited by Hui-Chun Chin and Tsung-Dao Lee Research Endowment Committee and I was honored the financial assistance for travel and registration.
