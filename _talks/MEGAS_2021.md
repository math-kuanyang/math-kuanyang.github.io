We discussed eigenvalue problem on manifolds, in particular the computation and the mesh generation.

Eigenvalue problems for speed and energy distribution on manifold are introduced, which advises the design of aircraft to enhance the structural stability and fuel economy. For the computation of the eigenvalue problems, mesh generation methods are proposed to support finite-element solution. Generation of mesh are changed to compare and maximize the efficiency, stability and precision in computation to in particular adapt to manifold with sharp and local properties. The mesh generation method could be expanded for the computation occurred in optimization issues in state-of-art industrial design. [Full-Text](/files/MEGAS_2021.pdf)
