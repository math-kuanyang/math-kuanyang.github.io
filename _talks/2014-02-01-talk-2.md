The talk focus on the co-existence of copper atoms / ions and oxygen vacancies in the conduction of Cu/ZnO/Pt RRAM.

---

We present the mapping of copper ions, oxygen vacancies and the current density in order to illustrate the conduction mechanism and the relative resisitive switching behavior. The complementary role of these two particles is found and we pointed out after the formation of Cu conductive filament, the oxygen vacancy plays a less dominant role in conduction. The results are vaildated by experiment.
